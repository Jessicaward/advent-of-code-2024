## Day 4a
So, I got most of the way through solving this when I realised I could solve it using dynamic programming lol.

I built a list of strings based on these interpretations of the wordsearch:
1. Across (left to right)
2. Across (right to left)
3. Down
4. Up
5. Diagonal (top left to bottom right)
6. Diagonal (top right to bottom left)
7. Diagonal (bottom left to top right)
8. Diagonal (bottom right to top left)
